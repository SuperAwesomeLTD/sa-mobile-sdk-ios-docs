Configure the SDK
=================

If you've added the SDK through CocoaPods, you can import the main SDK header file like so:

.. code-block:: c++

    #import "SuperAwesome.h"

If you've added the SDK as a .framework file, you can import the same SDK header file like so:

.. code-block:: c++

    #import <SuperAwesomeSDK/SuperAwesome.h>
