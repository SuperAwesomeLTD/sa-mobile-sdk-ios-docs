Measure installs
================

The AwesomeAds SDK contains a submodule that allows you to measure installs generated by CPI (Cost per Install) campaigns.

The submodule is already integrated in the main SDK but you can also install it as a standalone dependency, if you're an advertiser and just want to
measure installs without necessarily displaying ads.

With CocoaPods, just change your **Podfile** to include the following:

.. code-block:: shell

    target 'MyProject' do
        pod 'SACPI'
    end

and execute

.. code-block:: shell

    pod update

Once you've integrated the SDK or CPI submodule you'll need to call the **handleInstall** method.

The best place to add it is in your **AppDelegate**, in the **application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:** method.

.. code-block:: objective-c

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication* )application
      didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*) launchOptions {

        [[SACPI getInstance] handleInstall:^(BOOL success) {
          // handle callback
        }];

        return YES;
    }

The method will only run once per application lifecycle, usually when the application is first installed on a user's phone.

It also contains a simple callback with a boolean **success** parameter that lets you know if AwesomeAds considered this
install as having been generated by a CPI campaign.

.. warning:: Please be aware that not implementing this method at all will mean you won't be able to measure installs coming from
             AwesomeAds CPI campaigns, at all.
